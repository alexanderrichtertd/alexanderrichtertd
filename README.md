## Hi there 👋

Hi! I'm Alex, an Award-Winning Technical Director & Coach in Visual Effects, Animation and Games. 
My skills are solving technical problems, simplifying workflows and mentoring future Technical Directors.

I love films and games, but never thought about working on them, so I decided the "safe choice" to study law. 
My biggest decision was to switch from law to media computer science, where I discovered my passion for film and technology. 
This led me to study Technical Directing at the renowned Animationsinstitut in Germany.

This incredible education helped me work on blockbusters such as Avatar: The Way of Water (Oscar for "Best Visual Effects"), Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Monsters at Work, and The Amazing World of Gumball at the biggest studios like Weta FX, Framestore and Mackevision. For the short film Breaking Point I created the Open Source Pipeline Plex and we won the VES Award.

I'm excited to share my knowledge and experience with artists and technicians around the world after teaching at DNEG, ArtFx, FMX, CG Master Academy and now with you here. 
Together we create opportunities for you to succeed and work on incredible projects in the largest production studios.
